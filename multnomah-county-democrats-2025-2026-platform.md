Democratic Party of Multnomah County
2025 -26 Platform

Dear Multnomah County Democrats,

The draft of the 2025 -2026 Platform of the Democratic Party of Multnomah County was
presented to the Platform Convention on September 7, 2024, by the Platform, Resolution s and
Legislat ion Committee (PRLC) and was adopted by that Convention on that date.

In December of 2023, the PRLC started working on the 2025 -26 Platform by reviewing the 2022
Platform.  The Study Groups met and proposed deletions, additions and revisions.  The first draft
was posted on the website and virtual forums were held May 13 -18, 2024, to receive input from
county party members.  The second draft (which contained proposed LAIs) was posted on the
website in early June and a second round of virtual foru ms was held June 9 -14, 2024.  The final
draft of the Platform, with proposed Legis lative Action Items (LAIs) was completed on July 10,
2024.  It was posted on the website and notices were sent out to encourage Multnomah County
Democrats to register and attend the Platform Convention to be held September 7, 2024, at
Portland Community Co llege Southeast campus.

During the First Plenary Session of the Platform Convention, the Platform was amended and
adopted.
During article breakout sessions, Legislative Action Items were considered, amended and
forwarded to the Second Plenary Session for action.  Those LAIs were considered by the body
during the Second Plenary Session and adopted.

Congratulations to the PRLC  and all the participants a t both the virtual forums and the Platform
Convention for their successful completion of  a new platform.  It is visionary, progressive and
capable of being successful.

Thank you to everyone who worked to produce this Platform.

2025 -2026 DEMOCATIC PARTY OF MULTNOMAH COUNTY
PLATFORM

PREAMBLE

During a time plagued by an existential threat to democracies throughout the
world, the Democratic Party of Multnomah County crafted this platform as a
means to safeguard the principles it holds supreme.  Primary amongst these
principles is a commitment to  equity.  Never in the history of the United States of
America has our country endured such violent attacks upon our democracy.  Only
through uniting against the forces that strive to separate us as humans can we turn
the tide towards a government that pro vides freedom and opportunity for all its
people.  As inheritors of a racist society, we must work to rectify the injustices that
continue to be perpetuated upon the inhabitants of this land. We dedicate our work
to honor all those who have lived and labor ed here to make our lives possible.

### ARTICLE I – TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY {#article-i-tribal-sovereignty}

#### Preamble {#article-i-preamble}
This article upholds tribal sovereignty for some sixty thousand Indigenous people in Multnomah
County, accounting for the estimated growth since 2011. They are Indigenous to what is
currently known as the United States of America (US) and are known in fede ral legislation as
American Indians and Alaska Natives. Researchers describe a rigorous process to establish this
number in The Native American Community in Multnomah County: An Unsettling Profile
published in 2011. This Profile  also reports that nearly fo ur hundred tribal nations are
represented in Multnomah County from which each of these Indigenous people descends. For
574 tribal nations currently recognized by the US, their inherent sovereignty is affirmed in
treaties, the US Constitution, Supreme Court  precedent, and executive orders.
Because of their enduring strengths, Indigenous people over the centuries have demonstrated
their capacity to surmount extraordinary challenges and thrive. This is despite the Termination
Era when Congress sought to end their treaty obligations and forced Indigenous people to leave
their traditional lands and waters and move to urban areas. To uphold sovereignty and improve
the lives of Indigenous people throughout Multnomah County and beyond, this article focuses on
these areas: child welfare, Chemawa Indi an School, veterans, visitation for people who are
incarcerated, cultural items, workers in behavior health and early childhood, healthcare, housing,
and salmon.

#### Planks {#article-i-planks}
1. We affirm the inalienable sovereignty of tribal nations who -- since time immemorial -- have
belonged to the lands and waters of what is currently called the US. Wikipedia states,
“‘[T]ime immemorial’ appears as a legal term of art in judicial discussion o f common law
development and, in the [US], the property rights of Native Americans.”

2. We affirm that the unique, political relationship that tribal nations (within the US) maintain
with the federal government is based on treaties and not on race. As such, tribal nations and
their Indigenous constituents are not a “special interest” group.

3. We affirm that the US is responsible for honoring their trust obligation as well as the treaty
rights, sovereignty, and self -determination of tribal nations. According to officials of the
U.S. Department of the Interior, “The federal Indian trust responsibility  is a legal
obligation under which the [US] ‘has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest
responsibility and trust’ toward Indian tribes….” Supreme Court precedent upholds trust
doctrine as one of the most important principles in federal I ndian law.

4. We affirm, “Urbanization provides opportunities, but may also entail poverty, racism,
stigmatization, discrimination and marginalization,” as reported by Special Rapporteur on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the Office of the High Commissioner of the U nited
Nations Human Rights.

5. We recognize “the urgent need to respect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples
affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with [the United]
States,” as stated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-i-legislative-action-items}
1. We call for removing barriers for tribal nations and other entities serving Indigenous people
to gain access to prevention resources through the Title IV -E Prevention Services
Clearinghouse responding to the 2018 Family First Prevention Services Act. We also call for
development of more culturally -responsive, evidence -based and/or practice -based
prevention -interventions for In digenous people.
2. We call for upholding the federal and Oregon Indian Child Welfare Acts to maximize legally -
defined active -efforts (which are as affirmative, thorough, and timely as possible) to maintain
Indigenous parental custody, prevent removal from Indigenous parent(s ), or reunite each
Indigenous child with their Indigenous parent(s).
3. We call for increased accountability by the agencies of the State of Oregon for guardianship -
youth after permanency has been established to ensure optimal access to services for safe
transition to adulthood.
4. We call for Oregon’s Department of Human Services to facilitate foster -youths’ transition to
adulthood by eliminating the 14 -year cap to services to allow foster - and guardianship -youths

 access to the Independent Living Program. We also call for an audit of the practice of closing
services to youth if workers are unable to reach youth after three attempts.
5. We call for an audit of the use of psychiatric medicine for Indigenous youth in residential
care throughout Multnomah County. In 2022, the Multnomah County affiliate for the
National Alliance on Mental Illness reported this concern in “Improving Residentia l
Treatment Services for BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and People of Color] Youth.”
6. We call for a Truth and Healing Commission for Chemawa Indian School where
approximately 175 students are buried. We also call for engaging officials of church(es) who
were responsible for these students when they died between 1880 and 1945. The National
Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition initiated advocacy for this Commission.
7. We call for optimal access by Indigenous veterans to the Native American Direct Loan
Program, for example, by maintaining a low interest rate, helping veterans overcome barriers,
and/or bolstering their readiness for these loans. We also call for strengthe ning collaborative
partnerships for reaching out to potentially qualified Indigenous veterans.
8. We call for a task force to explore the possibility of implementing Indigenous peacemaking
as an option within the tribal offices and affiliated offices of the Oregon Department of
Human Services. This form of peacemaking is currently offered as an option in family courts
of participating tribal nations.
9. We advocate that barriers be removed and improve promotion for all forms of visitation
(such as in -person, online, and telephonic) with people who are incarcerated to reduce
recidivism and improve post -release outcomes such as employment and housing stabil ity.
10. We advocate for optimal resources for the Task Force on Oregon Tribal Cultural Items first
created by Oregon’s governor in 2017 through Executive Order No. 24 -06 to determine the
provenance of cultural items, their appropriate custodian, and appropriate st orage or display
of these items. The Task Force’s first annual report is due in 2025.
11. We advocate for increased financial and advisory support for Indigenous Behavioral -Health
workers and for their optimal access to incentives for increasing recruitment and retention of
these workers according to HB 2086 as enrolled. Incentives include path way development,
scholarships and stipends, loan repayments, and other retention activities.
12. We call for the State of Oregon to provide resources commensurate with need and inflation
rates to support the 120 -Hour Indigenized Professional Development Cohort for early -
childhood workers through a program that integrates Native language, culture, hist ories, and
oral stories for recovering and sustaining culture.
13. We call for a detailed, publicly -funded, single -payer, universal health plan that honors tribal
sovereignty and treaty obligations of the United States.
14. We call for more funding (for tribal nations and organizations serving primarily Indigenous
people) for inclusionary housing that is accessible and affordable for Indigenous people, for
example, by providing incentives to developers such as the ability to build increased density
and obtain other zoning variances.
15. We call for related government entities to uphold tribal sovereignty and food sovereignty
through the removal of the four Snake River dams to restore salmon runs and habitat and to
move toward fulfilling treaty obligations.


### ARTICLE II – EQUITY {#article-ii-equity}

#### Preamble {#article-ii-preamble}
The right to equitable outcomes is an important precept upon which a free society thrives.
Equality, in terms of social issues, has come to mean equal treatment for all.  Equity,
alternatively, recognizes the goal of having equal outcomes for all and, thus, the need for
employing differing methods to achieve those equal outcomes. We believe in t he inviolability of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and demand impartial treatment for all. We believe
in a society where everyone’s rights are protected and where equity and justice are the rule.  We
are committed to the elimination of all oppre ssion. The United States population is founded on
immigration; we must uphold that opportunity for current and future generations.

#### Planks {#article-ii-planks}
1. We believe in the right of all people to live in dignity, free from abuse, neglect, poverty,
violence and oppression.
2. We believe in an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) supporting equal opportunity, equal
pay and equal protection under the law for all women.
3. We believe that all consenting adults should have an equal right to civil marriage.
4. We believe in and support every person’s right to choose what is right for their own body.
5. We believe that all systems of oppression must be dismantled.
6. We believe in the right to quality health care for every person.
7. We believe the immigration process should be humane, racially equitable, predictable,
transparent, and provide due process, including provision of an attorney.  Children of
immigrants should not be separated from their parents; unaccompanied minors seeking
asylum should be treated respectfully and receive humane care.
8. We believe all people residing in the United States should be provided education, social
services, health care, and legal identification regardless of immigration status.
9. We believe all people residing in the United States have the right to determine their
identify, including gender.
10.  We support mechanisms to address hate speech and factual inaccuracy.
11. We advocate a diplomacy first policy.  Military action should be limited to the least
needed for defense of our nation and not used as preemptive aggression. Military support
for other nations should be dependent on their upholding human rights in accord w ith
international and U.S. law and should be subject to Congressional approval.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-ii-legislative-action-items}
1. A Constitutional amendment measure enshrining legal marriage between consenting
adults regardless of their gender or sexuality in the Oregon Constitution should be
referred to the people of Oregon.
2. A Constitutional amendment measure that safeguards reproductive rights by codifying
the individual’s right to all reproductive healthcare  and to eliminate barriers to abortion
services should be referred to the people of Oregon.
3. A ballot measure to protect gender -affirming care should be referred to the people of
Oregon. The ballot measure should include protections for parents of minor children and
mandatory reporters.
4. Policies and laws should be enacted to address systemic disparities, ensuring equitable
access to education, healthcare (including behavioral health), employment, and housing.
These policies and laws must be fully funded.
5. The Oregon legislature needs to allocate full funding for attorneys to assist immigrants
and refugees with immigration proceedings.
6. Legislation must be enacted that allows for medications and treatments that are used for
reproductive healthcare, and other medical  conditions,  to remain accessible for those
who need them.
7. In partnership with the public, local and state governments need to develop policy for
handling incidences of Civil Disobedience.
8. Oregon Health Authority should develop policy around the medication of youth that
provides equitable access to and prevents  over-medication of youth of color, youth with
disabilities, and youth in settings such as foster care.
9. The legislature should thoroughly assess the tax code and ensure that those at the lower
end of the economic system pay taxes at a lower rate and those at the higher end of
economic system pay a higher rate.

### ARTICLE III - EDUCATION {#article-iii-education}

#### Preamble {#article-iii-preamble}
We believe all public schools should be supported with equitable, stable and sustainable public
funding streams that provide all students with a high -quality education with culturally inclusive
curriculum from pre -kindergarten through high school and caree r training.  It achieves this
through developing thoughtful individuals who are collaborative problem -solvers and creative
thinkers when given access to a quality education and the tools to drive our economy forward.
We assert that quality public educatio n for all students enriches personal lives, strengthens our
economy and is critical to a well -functioning democracy.

#### Planks {#article-iii-planks}
1. We believe in education as a public good. Therefore, we support education as the right
for every person to have a quality, tuition -free education from preschool through the
university level.

2. We support full funding of the Quality Education Model (QEM). The QEM gives the
legislature, policy makers and district leaders an effective tool to evaluate the costs and
expected impacts in providing all students a quality education.

3. We oppose high -stakes standardized tests that according to quality research unfairly
label students of color, students with disabilities, students from low -income homes, and
English Language Learners (ELL) as “failing”. We oppose the marginalizing of social
studies, civics, science and the humanities due to an overemphasis on tested subjects. We
strongly urge the state of Oregon to withdraw from the Smarter Balanced Assessment
Consortium (SBAC ) and to adopt its own curriculum centered assessments that keep
PK-12 education student -centered.

4. We oppose any funding or resources being diverted from public schools and allocated to
private for -profit charter school businesses. We support measures to increase
accountability for private for -profit charter schools by requiring them to meet the same
standards of transparency as public schools. We oppose the outsourcing of substitute
teachers to third party for -profit businesses or to any type of agency outside of the public
school system.

5. We support developmentally appropriate early childhood education that fully
incorporates play -based and discovery -based learning. We oppose standardized testing
and an overemphasis on academics in the primary grades.

6. We believe access to basic computer science and computational thinking curriculum is a
basic right for all K -12 students in today’s economy and society.

7. We believe in the prioritization of high -quality STEAM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, Arts & Math) education, and the funding for underrepresented students,
including students of color and low -income students, to help remove enrollment and
achievement barriers in obtaining a STEAM education. Computer skills are essential for
K-12.

8. We believe that Multnomah County schools should strengthen their partnership with
business, unions and industry to better prepare students through career technical classes
and trade apprenticeship programs.

9. We oppose unregulated access to student information embedded in digital education
products.

 10. We support safe schools where students are provided with safe learning environments
free from lead paint, lead in water, asbestos, and other threats, such as poor ventilation
and air quality.

11. We support climate justice education at all grade levels.

12. We support the hiring of racially, ethnically, linguistically, culturally diverse and
professionally licensed teachers, the mentoring of all teachers new to the profession, and
meaningful professional development for all teachers.

13. We support the right of teachers’ unions and staff to collective bargaining. We
recommend the implementation of smaller class sizes based on quality research.

14. We support the forming and strengthening of relationships with indigenous people
through development of a statewide curriculum about Native American experience in
Oregon.

15. We recognize that native language academic instruction for students identified as
Limited English Proficient (LEP) provides equitable access to education. We support
evidenced -based dual -immersion programs for elementary grade students identified as
LEP.

16. We believe US history should be taught recognizing the contributions of all oppressed
groups who have been discriminated against in the development of our country, as well
as acknowledging the impact racism and oppression have had on our institutions.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-iii-legislative-action-items}
1. Fully fund the teaching of civics, critical thinking and media literacy.  These subjects should
be priorities in all Oregon Schools.
2. Oregon's Quality Education Model (QEM) is a comprehensive framework designed to ensure
that all PK -12 students in this state have access to a high -quality education, preparing them
for the future and ensuring that Oregon has a high -quality workforce.  We support fu ll
funding of the QEM through corporate tax revisions and financial services transaction fees
that dedicate monies for the QEM.
3. Provide legislation and funding to reduce class sizes to numbers based on reliable age -based
research studies.  In addition, the state funding formula must be adjusted to promote more
equitable class sizes across the state.  A reduction in class size can b e achieved by fully
funding the Quality Education Model.
4. Reduce the emphasis on standardized tests, which narrow the curriculum; we strongly
encourage the State of Oregon to withdraw from the Smarter Balanced Assessment
Consortium (SBAC), at every grade level, and return to high -quality standards and
assessments  that keep PK -12 education student -centered.
5. To reverse the consequences of narrowed curricula which shortchange Oregon’s students, we
support adequate funding of a full range of programs and services for PK -12.

 6. All Oregon PK -12 education spending should be directed to public schools.  Public funding
should not be used for the expansion of private or for -profit schools, vouchers of any type,
social impact bonds, experimental Ed Tech programs, virtual schools (outs ide of public
schools), religious instruction, or other mechanisms that weaken public schools by diverting
their funding while accelerating the privatization of education.
7. Immediately fund and aggressively implement the Oregon Department of Education and the
Higher Education Coordinating Commission Computer Science Education Statewide
Implementation Plan.
8. PK-12 public schools can be an important route to providing wraparound services to children
living in systemic poverty or who are highly mobile.  We recommend that adequate funding
be provided to schools to address poverty - and mobility -related traumas, in cluding by
providing funding for full staffing of  counselors, social workers, culturally relevant
curriculum and instruction, and other programs that have been proven effective in assuring
student success.
9. The Oregon Department of Education is responsible for protecting student data privacy by
exclusively granting contracts to companies that agree to protect student data privacy. We
recommend that limits be set on the types of personal student data collected  and stored in the
Statewide Longitudinal Database (SLD) and other state databases, that data be adequately
protected, and that an audit be performed to establish a baseline and monitor the rising cost
of maintaining the SLD in future years.
10. Racial discrimination and marginalization are shameful parts of Oregon’s history and, while
much progress has been made, more is needed.   To ensure continued progress, we demand
the honest portrayal of history and facts that accurately depicts the experie nce of
marginalized and colonized peoples including but not limited to Black, Indigenous, Latinx
and other people of color.
11.  Substitute teachers must be employees of the school districts to ensure continuity of the
pedagogy and school culture when the assigned teacher isn’t available.  We call for
legislation to require public school districts to employ substitute teachers and not to
outsource them from third -party for -profit staffing agencies.
12. Teacher burnout and turnover are major problems for our public schools.  To address these
problems, we call for a reassessment of teacher work responsibilities so that employment
expectations are realistic and fair.
13.  Social media is amplifying divisiveness rather than promoting civil discourse and is a
particular threat to the mental health of our children.  The European Union is far ahead of the
United States in addressing this problem.  A national response should be  led by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the US
Department of Justice (DOJ).
14.  Raise the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Oregon -set cap of
Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) so that a school district can receive funding above
11%, ensuring that there are built in safeguards to prevent abuse.
15.  We recommend full funding of any mandate issued by the state legislature to the schools and
school districts.


### ARTICLE IV – ANTI -BLACKNESS IN OREGON {#article-iv-anti-blackness-in-oregon}

#### Preamble {#article-iv-preamble}
From its inception in the 19th century, first as a U.S. territory and then a state, Oregon was
designed to be a “White -only” state with expressed exclusion of Black people via its
Constitution, legislation and public policy.  If our state truly hopes to heal from systemic racism
and Black exclusion, we must confront Oregon’s unique anti -Black history and the legacy of
disadvantage that affects Orego n’s Black population today.  The required remedies are
multifaceted.

#### Planks {#article-iv-planks}
1.  We support the city of Portland and the state of Oregon increasing the percentage and
number of government contracts that go to Black -owned businesses.
2. We believe that Black families who resided in previously redlined neighborhoods must be
made whole.
3. We strongly believe there should be a formal apology from the Oregon Legislature for its
past complicity in the State’s Black Exclusion laws and other anti -Black language in the
State’s constitution, dating back to 1844 and not formally removed until 2002.
4. We believe the Oregon State Legislature must publicly acknowledge the multi -
generational trauma, chronic poverty, underrepresented Black Oregon population and
other disparities between Black and White Oregonians are the direct result of racist laws
and pub lic policy.
5. We support creating a process of restorative and corrective justice for past racial harms
inflicted by local, city and state governments against American Descendants of Slavery
(ADOS) in Oregon.
6. We believe that the Democratic Party at the county and state level must support a
reparations package for ADOS Oregonians at the federal level that includes, but is not
limited to, the following:  cash payments, land allocations, protections from predatory
schemes, education scholarships, lineage therapy, and homeownership assistance.  We
further believe a reparations package should include multi -pronged policies and laws,
with the end goal of making ADOS families whole, thereby closing the lineage 10:1
wealth gap between ADOS Oregonians and White Oregonians.
7. Oregon state prison data shows that as of 2021, there were 307 white people and 1,670
Black people incarcerated per 100,000 resident population, 5.4 times more Black
individuals than their white counterparts.  This atrocity must be corrected through a
multitude of societal and criminal justice reforms.
8. Findings published in the Portland Business Journal concluded that in 2020, Oregon
banks made only four Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to African American
businesses.  Significant correction to the disparity between African American businesses
and other businesses must be a priority.

 9. African Americans have been disproportionately impacted by inequitable access to health
care.  We believe Oregon must enact policies to rectify this disparity.
10.  We support the inclusion of accurate Black history in all social studies and history
classes, including slavery, Oregon’s original Black exclusion, Jim Crow laws,
discriminatory practices, 20th century Civil Rights actions, and important contributions
and achievements of Black Americans.
11.  We support Affirmative Action in the U.S. as one means to remedy the results of prior
discrimination and ensure equitable higher education and employment opportunities for
African Americans and other disadvantaged groups.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-iv-legislative-action-items}
1. We call on local and state government to ensure that a minimum of 6% of government
contracts be awarded to small Black -owned businesses.
2. We call for local and state government to work in tandem with federal government to
ensure that a minimum of 6% of Small Business Administration (SBA) loans are
allocated to Black Portlanders and that a minimum of 3% go to Black Oregonians
statewide.
3. The State of Oregon must create a special office, advised by a community  advisory
board, and a database to locate and track the families who were redlined between the
1940s and 1960s and provide equitable recompense. Policy remedies must prioritize
those people who were directly impacted by redlining and/or their descendants.
4. We call on the State of Oregon to authorize bank audits to expose patterns of racial
discrimination in lending and to require banks to extend and increase loans to Black
businesses, Black institutions and prospective homebuyers.
5. We call for forming a State Committee to consider  reparations, including financial redress
and other supportive measures for eligible Black residents of Oregon.
6. We call on the Oregon State Government, the City of Portland and Multnomah County to
publish a live database of statistics about the Black populations impacted by the legal
system.
7. We call for a review of punishments being levied disproportionally on Black Oregonians,
such as charging resulting in mandatory long sentences or time served before parole can
be considered. We call for annual publication of results of that review. We call  for
significant criminal justice reform for Oregon’s over -incarcerated Black population.

### ARTICLE V – GOVERNANCE {#article-v-governance}

#### Preamble {#article-v-preamble}
A Representative Democracy is meant to be the result of the fair contention between ideas and
not money or power.  We are dedicated to election integrity, ensuring all eligible voters can vote
without hardship and that all votes are counted.  We address go vernance and election issues,
promoting public understanding, equality and equity.  We believe integrity requires both strong
advocacy for ideas and the energy for their implementation.

#### Planks {#article-v-planks}
1. We support full transparency of all actions, officials, campaigns and candidates in state, local
government and the Democratic Party
2. We believe in holding our elected officials to a higher standard of public scrutiny, rebuking
any who denigrate the public or engage in activities with even a potential appearance of
impropriety or corruption.
3. We support government adoption, in all levels of jurisdiction, of voting methods that
eliminate vote splitting and assure winners are elected by the majority.
4. We believe no corporate entity should be assigned the right of natural persons and that money
should not be regarded as constitutionally protected speech.
5. We support campaign finance reform, demanding strict limits on contributions, donor
disclosure and small donor public financing.
6. We believe democracy requires open debate, representation of all people, respect for minority
participation, minimized obstruction and final decision by the majority.
7. We believe in strict adherence to the Constitution, including separation of powers, checks and
balances among branches locally and federally, and upholding the protections of the Bill of
Rights.
8. We believe the Democratic Party should practice policies which promote impartiality and
opportunity for the development of new ideas and candidates.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-v-legislative-action-items}
1. We support an Oregon Constitutional Amendment to create a non -partisan commission
for redistricting.
2. We support legislation providing voting rights for all incarcerated citizens.
3. We support the enactment of legislation or constitutional amendment(s):
a. limiting the influence of donations and lobbying by private or corporate wealth
upon elections.
b. limiting campaign spending.
c. supporting public financing of elections.
d. making the electoral process more transparent, including full disclosure of
contributions with close monitoring of the entire process (Federal, State and

 4. We support granting voting rights to US Citizens residing in Washington D.C. and US
territories.
5. We support government policies and practices that promote voter participation and
education such as
a. National Election Day,
b. automatic voter registration at the age of 18 and when adults become citizens,
c. Vote-by-Mail through the US Postal Service, and
d. Stay of voter roll purges without adequate notification and time for response.

6. We will actively pursue representation that reflects the diversity of its registered voters
throughout the Party Platform development process.
7. We call for a timely evaluation of the implementation of the Portland Charter Review
Commission recommendations.
8. We support the implementation of alternative voting methods such as ranked choice

post systems like vote -splitting spoiler -effect, partisanship and plurality voting.  We
advocate for the further study of proportional representation.
9. We endorse the formation of a study group to explore alternatives to Robert’s Rules of
Order, and their potential applicability.
10. We support the full enforcement of existing law that judges and justices recuse
themselves from cases involving conflicts of interest or the appearance thereof, and the
adoption of legal requirements on judges and justices not covered by current law.
11. We support laws and policies to allow residents to vote in local elections regardless of
citizenship.

### ARTICLE VI – CRIMINAL JUSTICE {#article-vi-criminal-justice}

#### Preamble {#article-vi-preamble}
The criminal justice systems within the United States of America, at the federal, state, and local
levels, demonstrably fall well short of the minimum standards of fairness and equity, making
these so -called justice systems patently unjust. The criminal justice system should be reform ed
so that it operates fairly and equitably, while respecting the dignity and humanity of those
interacting with the system. We oppose a criminal justice system that discriminates against
people of color and poor people, fails to adequately provide for pub lic defense, fails to recognize
addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal  issue, promotes mass incarceration and
punishment instead of rehabilitation and restorative justice, fails to hold police accountable for
abuses of power, doesn't me et the needs of individuals returning from incarceration, and fails to
adequately fund services that help prevent crime and services that assist people in crisis. We call
upon our government at the local, state, and federal levels to examine the system’s f ailings and
provide laws and funding to identify and remedy its problems and prevent future inequity.

#### Planks {#article-vi-planks}
1. We acknowledge that punishment and incarceration have failed to eliminate violence or to
provide community safety or equity.  Our criminal justice system should shift to a
rehabilitative system, including more access to education and other programs. We sup port
Restorative Justice encounters between victim and harm -doer as an alternative to
imprisonment.
2. We believe in preventing violence and other criminal behavior by greatly expanding and
funding needed services and opportunities in our communities, especially those that have
been most harmed and least helped by the public safety and criminal justice syst ems,
including communities of color, rural residents, and Native Americans.
3. We support alternatives to traditional policing, such as community policing, replacing police
with other first -responders when appropriate to the situation, police officers being residents
in the jurisdictions in which they work, and law enforcement accoun tability for their
treatment of individuals.
4. We oppose any policing that discriminates against poor people, people of color, or any
protected category of residents.  We oppose selective targeting, illegal or unethical
interrogations, unscientific eyewitness identifications, ubiquitous surveillance, a nd unreliable
facial recognition software.
5. We oppose any unfair and biased legal system practices such as prosecutorial overcharging,
coercive plea bargains, money bail, excessive penalties and fees for inability to pay fines, and
any practices that result in a disproportionate number of people of color and economically
disadvantaged people being charged, convicted, and incarcerated.
6. We believe the unique circumstances of each defendant, crime and victim should always be
considered in applying sentences. We support earned reductions in sentence, benefiting both
prison staff and incarcerated individuals. We recognize that mandatory sent encing has
disproportionately impacted poor people and people of color in our communities.
7. We support expansion of public defense in Oregon, including incentives, equitable
compensation of attorneys and staff, and manageable caseloads.
8. We believe no one should profit from the incarceration of others and decisions about prisoner
conditions should not depend on anybody's profit, including from underpaying for prisoner
jobs, and from prisoner phone calls, video visits, and money transfers, or inflated
commissary prices, all of which also impacts prisoners’ loved ones.
9. We oppose all inhumane treatment of prisoners, such as solitary confinement; harmful or
humiliating physical restraints; neglect of medical conditions, the elderly, people with
disabilities, the terminally ill, those unable to function independently, and s pecial needs of
women and of cultural groups. Humane treatment includes healthy food and outdoor
exercise.
10.  We believe drug addiction should be treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal
issue, that treatment should be readily available for all who want it, and that all drug use and
possession for personal use should be fully decriminalized.
11. We support evidenced -based and other measures that can prevent gun violence, including
homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings.

 12. We oppose both the death penalty and life without parole sentences, for several reasons
including wrongful convictions, discriminatory application, and failure to acknowledge the
possibility of redemption.
13. We support helping previously incarcerated individuals, whether they have completed their
sentence or are under probation or post -prison supervision, to successfully reintegrate into
society by removing barriers to housing, education, training programs, jo bs and by providing
other assistance.
14. We believe that no incarcerated citizens should lose their right to vote.
15. We oppose the "school -to-prison pipeline" that funnels children out of their public schools
into the criminal justice system, as a means of disciplining students in school, and at the same
time disproportionately impacts students of color.
16. We support due process for all asylum seekers at the US border. We oppose inhumane
treatment and living conditions for all people detained for possible deportation, especially the
abhorrent practice of separation of family members. We oppose criminalizatio n of efforts to
help immigrants and undocumented residents.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-vi-legislative-action-items}
1. We support legislation, policies, and funding to provide alternatives to incarceration where
appropriate. With the goal of repealing mandatory minimum sentencing, we support all
legislation that offers alternatives and exceptions, allows for earned time of f sentences, or
removes any crime from the mandatory sentencing list, substituting guidelines in its place.
2. We support organizing and funding well -trained and fully staffed non -police teams to
intervene in mental and behavioral health crisis situations in our communities on a 24 -hour
basis.
3. We call on the Oregon legislature to fund pay equity for public defenders, prosecutors, and
their staffs; and we will support legislation that incentivizes lawyers to be public defenders.
4. We support evidence -based and other legislation to prevent gun violence, including
homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings, such as universal background checks, gun
owner licensing, accessible  safe storage, and mandatory safety and handling classes. We
oppose ownership and use, whether by civilians or police or domestically -deployed military,
of weaponry and ammunition that are inappropriate for personal self -defense,  hunting, or
sport.
5. We support legislation protecting the rights and safety of incarcerated women and
addressing the particular needs relevant to their gender.
6. We support legislation that will expand the early release program for incarcerated people
close to death or unable to function independently.
7. All citizens should be allowed to register and vote while incarcerated.
8. We support creation of a fair system of prisoner work and compensation, by voter removal
of Oregon Constitution, Section 41, Article 1 and then replacing it with a new work,
education and skill -training system designed by a state board of community members .
9. To cut the “school -to-prison pipeline” and protect students and educators’ civil liberties, we
support a statewide ban on the stationing of law enforcement officers in Oregon primary and
secondary schools.

 10. We oppose charging juvenile defendants as adults.
11. We support evidence -based legislation that funds communities heavily impacted by gun
violence, focusing on addressing the root causes of behavioral violence, including structural
violence, racism, and other forms of oppression. Priorities include place -based
environmental design, crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED), and long -
term sustainability for community -based organizations tackling homicides and violence.
12. We support a uniform department of public defenders within the Oregon Department of
Justice staffed with fully funded attorneys that are trained and qualified and have
manageable caseloads whose job is to provide criminal defense when a court appointed
attorney is required.
13. We support improvements to the reentry process for the formerly incarcerated, including
access to more education and training while inside and access to licensure after release.
14. We oppose efforts to criminalize homelessness.
15. We oppose the privatization of all aspects of the carceral system.
16. We call for eliminating charges for telecommunications for incarcerated individuals.

### ARTICLE VII – ENVIRONMENT {#article-vii-environment}

#### Preamble {#article-vii-preamble}
We recognize the current climate emergency requires immediate action to avoid catastrophic
warming, and triggering irreversible impacts that threaten to make our planet uninhabitable. We
support an aggressive and robust timeline for implementing controls o n greenhouse gas
emissions in all sectors of the economy. We support legislation that improves Oregon’s resilience
to climate threats, eliminating “forever chemicals” and plastics, and transitioning land
management practices towards those that are sustaina ble, regenerative and sequester the greatest
amount of carbon possible. We advocate for environmental justice, equity, and inclusion. We call
for centering and protecting historically marginalized populations, particularly indigenous
nations, in discussion s and policies that affect the environment, and demand that legislation
include Free Prior and Informed Consent of tribal nations. Efforts to protect the planet and save
humanity from climate disasters must be focused and measurable.

#### Planks {#article-vii-planks}
1. We believe that all people and lifeforms have the inalienable right to a habitable planet,
healthy local environments and accessible natural spaces. We recognize the necessity of
adequate clean air, water, and healthy soils. We consider thriving oceans, es tuaries,
freshwater ecosystems, rangelands, and forests as indispensable, and management of these
resources should reflect their societal values.
2. We believe policies related to the environment and our climate must be framed within our
justice and equity goals, including the just transition of displaced workers, low -income

 communities and other historically marginalized populations. These policies must address the
intentional placement of pollution generating activities near marginalized communities.
3. We believe rapidly reducing greenhouse gasses across all sectors and systems (building,
transportation, energy, agriculture, etc.) is paramount, including aggressively enforcing and
monitoring greenhouse gasses and all other environmental hazards. We belie ve enforcement
means violators are held accountable to clean -up impacts to affected communities. Reducing
greenhouse gasses also demands immediate divestment from fossil fuels and a rapid
transition away from fossil fuel infrastructure.
4. We advocate for policies that prioritize capturing and sequestering carbon on Oregon’s
natural and working lands, in balance with the needs of those who live on and work the land.
We oppose using Oregon’s natural carbon storage as justification for allowin g further
unaddressed carbon emissions.
5. We believe we must act to protect native, keystone, endangered and threatened species
through applied scientific, evidence and equity -based efforts.
6. We believe public land, resources, and waterways are inviolable and should be held and
managed for the common good. We encourage collaborative partnerships committed to
acquiring and preserving land for the common good. Regulating land use is essential for
preserving farm, range, and forests and managing transportation.
7. We believe that Oregon’s ecosystems should be valued, not by the raw goods they offer, but
by the ecosystem services they provide, including, but not limited to, habitat, biodiversity,
oxygen production, and air and water purification. Failing to protect n atural systems that all
life depends  on, through inadequate  regulation and enforcement, is an abuse of power.
8. We support policies that support sustainable management of Oregon’s land and water
resources through regenerative practices. Further, we advocate for immediate management of
Oregon’s water crisis by expanding and protecting watersheds and aquifers; enactin g water
conservation, reclamation, and retention policies; and ensuring policies are enacted to
prepare for periods of water scarcity.
9. We support statewide waste reduction and expanding recycling and reuse programs,
including rights to repair. We strongly support legislation to eliminate fossil -fuel based
plastics and other non -degradable products, beginning with non -recyclable and single -use
plastics, and stringent policies to regulate pollution.
10. We oppose unsafe rail transport of fossil fuels through our state. We believe our state’s
railways, rivers, and communities should not be threatened by the possibility of explosive
derailment of frequent oil trains. We believe our leaders and regulatory bo dies should do
more to reduce and withdraw from such oil transport.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-vii-legislative-action-items}
1. Rollback all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies and ban any net new fossil fuel
infrastructure.
2. Facilitate residential/multi -family/community/commercial solar generation, micro grids,
and personal wind and electric storage with feed -in tariffs comparable to those awarded

 large scale energy suppliers. Advocate for direct payment and other market mechanisms for
incentives.
3. Incorporate an environmental rights amendment into the Oregon Constitution that
establishes an affirmative mandate to protect our natural resources and require state
agencies to modify practices accordingly.
4. Every new energy or emissions bill must be rated and prioritized by the amount of carbon
it displaces, sequesters, or captures.
5. We support a Soils Protection Act that incentivizes a transition of Oregon’s agricultural
sector from farming practices that currently degrade existing soil resources, mine soil
organic matter and kill soil -borne biota, to regenerative practices that reduc e soil
compaction and erosion, contribute organic material to soils, and re -establish and allow
native soil biota to flourish.
6. We support legislation that provides for establishing a single state Green House Gas
(GHG) audit standard that includes logging emissions, Oregon consumption of imported
goods and foods, and all the other emissions currently documented by OR Department of
Energy and provides for a yearly report on the reductions in emissions and increase in
sequestration in natural and working lands.
7. We support continued implementation of the Portland Clean Energy Fund along with
passing similar initiatives in other cities, counties and the state. We oppose the reallocation
of these funds for unintended purposes.
8. Existing concentrated industrial animal feeding operations must comply with current DEQ
air and water pollution standards, nuisance odor, and other external pollution that harms
any neighbor, and ultimately should be banned.
9. Oregon must protect and restore wetlands to ensure habitat for migrating birds and other
wildlife as well as providing crucial benefits, from flood reduction to water filtration and
sequestration.
10.  Reinstitute the timber severance tax to support counties, incentivize better stewardship,
longer logging rotations, protect drinking watersheds and pay for firefighting.
11.  Require net zero carbon building codes by 2030. Ban gas hookups in new buildings and
allow state REACH codes to be adopted by local jurisdictions.
12.  Divest PERS from fossil fuel companies and their supporting industries.
13.  Change the Highway Trust Fund to allow the gas tax to support alternative modes of
transportation.
14.  Evaluate the impacts of the Critical Energy Infrastructure (CEI) Hub and implement
effective measures to remediate/remove and restore the land, and promote public safety.
15.  Pass a climate forest carbon plan and other policies for Oregon’s state and private lands
that eliminate tax incentives for forests not employing selective, sustainable logging.
Markedly improve Oregon’s Forest Practices Act to protect wildlife, drinking water, and
post-fire protections. Maximize forest stewardship certification and forest protection and
develop treatments to restore healthy forest soils.
16.  Apply the social cost of carbon or other accounting systems along with maximizing
drinking water protections to develop a new set of rules on the best use of state forest
lands.

 17.  De-fund the Oregon Forest Resources Institute to prevent state sponsored corporate
lobbying.
18.  Develop drought plans for drinking -water watersheds and areas with declining
groundwater and require re -allocation of water rights for the environment and human
consumption.
19.  Ban single use consumer plastic.
20.  Support mechanisms to reduce food waste.
21.  Increase access to physical sites of pollution sources for monitoring and enforcement.
Increase fines for air and water pollution on industrial agriculture and timber management.
22.  Advocate for a federal -level carbon tax on all goods, based on a life cycle analysis of their
carbon footprint.
23. We support increased air, water, noise pollution monitoring across the state.
24.  We support the requirement of government purchase/procurement of renewable energy
sources and infrastructure.

### ARTICLE VIII – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY {#article-viii-science-and-technology}

#### Preamble {#article-viii-preamble}
Multnomah Democrats believe evidence -based science should form the basis for many of the
decisions the government makes, particularly regarding health and the environment. Basic
research in science and technology are cornerstones for the future. We welcome  innovation in all
scientific arenas; however, the scientific community, both alone and in cooperation with the
government, has the responsibility to protect the public from harm caused by incomplete
understanding or misapplication of new technologies. We embrace the new frontiers of discovery
and development in science, medicine, information, artificial intelligence, robotics, energy,
transportation, space sciences, ocean sciences, and new fields as they emerge, with the
expectation that the fruits of thes e endeavors benefit all humankind equally and equitably. We
recognize that our global integration requires attention to the broad societal impacts of these
developments.

#### Planks {#article-viii-planks}
1. We believe an open and democratic internet is critical to technological progress. In
particular, we support universal access through public broadband and net neutrality; strong
privacy protections, particularly for medical and financial information, for all data sharing
applications; and robust data encryption protection uninhibited by back doors or key
escrow.
2. We support medical research for the purpose of eliminating disease, preventing
pandemics, aiding recovery, and improving quality of life. Researchers must take care to
address racial, gender and cultural bias in research, in order to improve patient outcom es.

 3. We believe artificial intelligence research and development must be conducted within
strict ethical and moral regulations. We believe developers must respect intellectual
property rights; enhance, not replace, the value of human labor; avoid invasions of
privacy; minimize carbon impact and technological waste; prevent racial, gender or
cultural bias; and benefit all humankind equally and equitably.
4. We support state and federal funding of basic and applied research at academic institutions
and public -private partnerships, with provisions for transparency, accountability, and
equitable protection of public interests. We believe all publicly funded rese arch should be
openly shared.
5. We believe the United States should actively participate in space exploration. Our space
program should cooperate with all humanity, for the betterment of humankind. NASA
should be adequately funded for this purpose. We oppose privatization and outsourcing  of
space exploration. We believe that space belongs to humanity, not corporations.
6. We oppose whole human cloning until ethical and legal questions are resolved. We support
curing diseases via in vivo genetic editing and the cloning of individual organs.
7. We believe in advancing transportation and energy technologies that do not produce
greenhouse gasses.
8. We support more deployment of advanced sensing technologies to predict weather,
earthquakes, and tsunamis, and help protect lives and property from their destructive
effects. We support continued improvement in climate modeling.
9. We support right -to-repair policies, especially relating to electronics and farming
equipment. The lack of these policies disproportionately impacts rural communities, low -
income people, and Black, Indigenous, and other people of color.
10. We believe Oregon needs to create additional, state -sponsored research facilities outside
the university system so that scientists trained in Oregon can work in Oregon and to
promote the development of capacity in the Oregon economy.
11. We believe that free and open -source software (FOSS), as defined by the Open Source
Initiative, is critical, cost -effective public infrastructure. We support reliable public and
private funding of FOSS to deliver services and create opportunities for indiv iduals and
for organizations of all sizes.
12. We resolve to ensure that the exploration of our planet’s oceans have value to society,
mankind, and the sustainability of our planet. We believe ocean exploration must not harm
wildlife or human life, and the safety of explorers must be of the utmost impo rtance in all
stages of exploration.
13. We believe society and culture has a vested interest in governments regulating the market
of cryptocurrencies and non -fungible tokens (NFTs), to address environmental impact,
societal harm, intellectual property rights, criminal use, and privacy concerns.
Regulations, similar to other investment instruments and equities should include algorithm
transparency.
14. We believe using surveillance, digital and manual, when it violates people's civil rights is
an abuse of power. In particular, we believe cybersecurity laws should include technical
standards to safeguard all reproductive healthcare data, including through  end-to-end
encryption in transit and at rest.


#### Legislative Action Items {#article-viii-legislative-action-items}
1. Pass a federal Right To Repair law that mirrors that of the Oregon law passed in the 2024
Short Session (SB 542)
2. Enact legislation and policies requiring companies to disclose, in plain language and to
all customers, what information they gather, how it is used, and whether it is sold to third
parties. If the information is used to train AI models, tech companies mus t disclose the
purpose of those models.
3. Enact laws to curtail hate speech and intentional disinformation on social media.
4. Pass laws proactively regulating research, development, and deployment of
cryptocurrency, non -fungible tokens (NFTs), and artificial intelligence (AI), with the
goals of: protecting consumer rights, privacy, and intellectual property rights; preventing
criminal use; preventing gross wealth inequity; fighting misinformation; protecting
human labor; eliminating racial, gender, or cultural bias; and limiting carbon and
electronic component pollution.
5. Provide reliable long -term funding for free and open source (FOSS) projects; identify
critical gaps in FOSS support; provide additional funding to close those gaps; encourage
adoption of FOSS by governments at all levels.
6. Enact federal laws allowing government agencies to set minimum security requirements
for protecting patient healthcare data.
7. Pass state and federal laws mandating that reproductive health information is encrypted to
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards both in transit and at
rest, such that app maintainers and third parties cannot access that informati on.
8. Follow the scientific consensus on the climate crisis, and ensure that future legislation
and policies are evidence -based as opposed to greenwashing suggested by polluting
industries.
9. When passing and funding climate legislation, give serious consideration to science -
based natural solutions, such as preserving mature and old -growth forests, wetlands, and
the world’s oceans. Prioritize implementing indigenous and innovative agricultural
practices and other ecologically sound projects to protect our planet and food systems.
10.   We call for the prioritization of public safety in the deployment of all autonomous
systems, including, but not limited to self -driving vehicles.  This includes requiring
human -operable failsafe systems.
11.   Technical producers, including, but not limited to social media platforms, must be held
accountable for safeguards in their products.  This should include enactment and
enforcement of consumer protection, tort liability, and anti -trust laws.
12.   Enact legislation and policies protecting the right to privacy and the right to encrypt
personal information, both in transit and at rest.
13.   Enact legislation and policies requiring carbon -free energy for all new data center
development.


### ARTICLE IX – ECONOMY {#article-ix-economy}

#### Preamble {#article-ix-preamble}
The job of our government in managing our economy is to promote the wellbeing of all, prevent
suffering, protect basic rights, and prioritize our common welfare and shared benefits over the
private privilege and status of favored individuals. The economy's function is to create and
manage the means and agencies of production, distribution, consumption, and investment of
useful goods and services so as to underwrite the development and welfare of the people living in
its jurisdiction. Nature provides the basis of what we need to do to survive and grow. Human
innovation derives and develops from this basis the economy's productive support systems that
we call infrastructure. All infrastructure is subject to change as we humans encounter new
challenges and discover new possibilities. To accomplish this, we must imaginatively employ
science, multifaceted general education, and investment capital under a s ocially viable
organization.

#### Planks {#article-ix-planks}
1. We support comprehensive capital improvements, including public works, to maintain,
preserve, upgrade or replace infrastructure as a supply -line of human development.
2. We affirm that all construction and uses of infrastructure be directed through the
framework of social justice, environmental impact, and public good for all actions, and
through consultation with Tribal Nations when affected by these projects.
3. We seek and support means to reduce barriers to infrastructure and capital development
for private and public sectors, and reduction of costs of public infrastructure relative to
return. Making developments that are scalable, low cost, and hiring enough pe ople to
make sure the projects get done on time should be a priority.
4. Within the framework of nationally integrated development, we support targeted
investments in infrastructure to improve opportunities for small enterprises to grow with
emphasis on projects that use local companies and materials and include disadvantaged
businesses and workers in all phases of the projects.
5. We support revitalized high -quality K -14 programs of public education together with
supporting infrastructure as an economic  necessity.
6. We support  quality health care for every person together with an effective pandemic -
response infrastructure as necessary to maintain the economy’s productive powers.
7. Consistent with networking productive human activity, we support continuation of
publicly owned and operated six -day door -to-door post office mail delivery for all
businesses and residences.
8. Consistent with construction and expansion of infrastructure that replaces high CO2
emitters, we support the reduction in air and road traffic by increasing both modern
freight and high -speed passenger rail.
9. To underwrite the productive powers of  workers, we support free and/or affordable, high -
quality child -care programs for all children.

 10. Because a  decent standard of living for every working person is necessary for
maintaining the productive power of the economy,  employers who exploit undocumented
workers must face serious penalties.
11. Likewise, we support a universal basic income as essential for maintaining a healthy
economy and workforce, and for spurring innovation and creativity - even through
changing environmental, social and technological circumstances.
12. We support joint North -Central -South America infrastructure development as vital to our
economic and social stability, and as a means of repairing relationships damaged by past
U.S. military and undercover police actions.
13. We support  as a source of economic power the  continuation of extraterrestrial exploration
of our universe, to extend the reach of our understanding of Earth and open new and
unfathomed modes of infrastructure.
14. We support employing the full powers of federal and state laws and agencies in
prioritizing stewardship over forest, land and water resources, recognizing that protection
and restoration of biodiverse forests is a cornerstone of managing the atmospheric
interplay of carbon and oxygen upon which plant and animal life depend.
15. We support the conservation of at least 30 percent of the nation’s land and water by 2030
and suspension of requirements for leaseholders to extract, graze, divert, harvest, or
otherwise develop resources. This will allow “nonuse rights” needed for land us e
conservation.
16. Because the economy’s productive powers need the maximum concentration of useful
resources to feed, educate, house, and preserve our people, institutions trading in
financial instruments such as stocks, bonds and derivatives  need to be separated
from  produ ctive -assets banking  and regulated  outside the protections and subsidies
afforded the  latter banking sector.
17. Because marketplace incentives to cut costs and maximize profits can be at odds with
some services critical to the general welfare of our people, such services as the public
education and prison systems, postal and firefighting services, and aspects of foo d
production and supply -line, need to be safeguarded from the forces of a market economy.
18.  Human potential being the true source of economic wealth and value, we need a General
Welfare Index to subordinate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a measure of the well -
being of the people living under the economy.

#### Legislative Action Items {#article-ix-legislative-action-items}
1. As part of securing sufficient water supply for consumption, irrigation, and waste
management, we call for the legislature to issue a report on the implementation of
Oregon’s Integrated Water Resources Strategy and the utilization of the committed funds.
2. As part of securing adequate food production for our people, we support family farms in
Oregon .
3. Given the current demand outpacing the supply of housing, we call on the government to
increase the supply of housing, including greatly increased affordable housing.
4. Given our recent experience with the COVID pandemic, we call on the government to
ensure that we can protect the public health and prepare for any future pandemic.

 5. Given the need for sufficient safe electrical and fuel energy for industrial and residential
uses, we seek enabling legislation and funding by Multnomah County and all cities
within the county to implement the Critical Energy Security Strategy adopted by t he
Multnomah County Democratic Party.
6. We call on the government to ensure the solvency of the banking and insurance industries
underwriting the pension systems.
7. We support the establishment of a state bank.
8. We support apprenticeship and internship programs; and we support enforcement of
prevailing wage requirements for infrastructure projects.

### ARTICLE X – FOREIGN POLICY {#article-x-foreign-policy}

#### Preamble {#article-x-preamble}
The Democratic Party of Multnomah County understands that while we are a county party, and
as such are primarily focused on local and state level issues, we are also the largest voting bloc of
Democratic voters in Oregon.   As such, there are issues worldwide that demand our attention and
voice.
We advocate a diplomacy first foreign policy, with the use of military force being viewed as a
last resort when diplomacy has failed or clearly will fail.   We support the recognition of human
rights worldwide, and the use of diplomacy to encourage other nations to match our high
standards in this regard, in particular the human rights of racial and ethnic minority groups,
women, and LGBTQ populati ons.  We share the goal of the Democratic Party of Oregon in this
arena:   Our ultimate foreign policy goal is a world free from war and oppression.

#### Planks {#article-x-planks}
1. We advocate a diplomacy first policy.   Military action should be limited to the least
needed for defense of our nation and not used as preemptive aggression. Military support
for other nations should be dependent on their upholding human rights in accord w ith
international and US Law, and should be subject to Congressional approval.
2. The US must promote peace, democracy, human rights, diplomacy, and cooperation
abroad.
3. We believe there should be clear evidence of danger  to our own country or to our allies
plus approval from Congress, before the US government takes any military action in
another country. Actions "in our national interest" must always be clearly defined.
4. The US government should prioritize involvement of civil service and military personnel
in national security operations over private military contractors, and require that military
contractors be held accountable for misconduct to at least military standar ds and US Law .

 5. We support reducing the US military budget to fund only what is actually needed for the
defense of our country and redirect funds to support social programs and our economy.
6. The US government should support and financially contribute to the United Nations and
other international organizations that promote diplomacy, prevent violence and
discrimination, and provide humanitarian aid and health care.
7. We support reducing the amount of money used to fund US military bases in other
countries.
8. We believe that occupation and mistreatment of occupied people are untenable situations
that will always lead to resistance and violence; our government should use its influence
to bring about equitable solutions, respecting rulings by the International Co urt of Justice.
9. We believe the US government should support rulings of the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).
10. We believe the US should always publicly condemn the intentional denial or blocking of
